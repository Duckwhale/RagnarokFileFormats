# Ragnarok Online File Formats Manifest

Gravity Co has used some fairly arcane file formats in creating their first MMORPG client, presumably supported by custom (in-house) or now-obsolete software.

This repository contains my findings from researching how they work and how they can be used or modified, alongside sources and links that at times have been quite difficult to track down after all these years.

Hopefully having it all collected in a git repository will allow the information to be available for many years to come. Feel free to do with this information as you please!

Obvious disclaimer: I don't claim credit for the findings and results of the hard work that others have put into analysing these file formats. Sometimes it's impossible to say who originally discovered the various details due to the passage of time and obscure sources I had to consult, but I'll list my sources as best as possible.
