# Ragnarok Online File Formats Manifest

Gravity Co. has used some fairly arcane file formats in creating their MMORPG client, presumably created by in-house or now-obsolete software.

This repository contains my findings from researching how they work and how they can be used or modified, alongside sources and links that at times have been quite difficult to track down after all these years.

Hopefully having it all collected in a git repository will allow the information to be available for many years to come.

I do not claim credit for the findings and results of the hard work that others have put into analysing the file formats. I'm listing the original author where I can, though sometimes it is impossible to say who originally did what due to the passage of time and obscure sources I had to consult.
