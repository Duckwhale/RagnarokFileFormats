# Unused file formats

These formats are likely unused and only of historical interest:

## SFK

There's like... one accidental file in the entire data folder, alongside some alpha screenshots and notes written in text files. Hardly seems worth the effort.

## RSX

> Think RSM but for actors

Haven't seen a single one of these, so I can't say more.

### IMF

The only information I could find was this:

> They also made new formats, like the worthless IMF format that no one understand what is supposed to do... (Just kidding, IMF is used when combining ACT files for player characters, but it turns out it wasn't really necessary or useful. The client uses IMF offsets when drawing the player on the character select, which is probably why headgear sometimes looks a little wonky there. It also uses it for drawing order for player character sprites in-game.)

As far as I know, these files are leftovers from Arcturus and not really used for anything but rendering sprites on the UI layer, e.g. in the character selection screen and in the equipment window.

The UI/World layers are explained in the [ACT specification](../ACT.MD).
