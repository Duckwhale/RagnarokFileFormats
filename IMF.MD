### IMF

Status: Mostly ignored (for now)

From what I can see, these files are leftovers from Arcturus and not really used for anything but rendering sprites on the UI layer, e.g. in the character selection screen and in the equipment window.

Since no sane (and more modern) approach would ever do this, I've not looked into it more.
